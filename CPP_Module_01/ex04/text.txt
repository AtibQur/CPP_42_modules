I'm gonna thriller tonight
Killer, thriller
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'awl's neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thriller tonight
'Cause this is thriller
'Cause this is thriller
'Cause this is thriller
'Cause this is thriller
Killer thriller (Thriller tonight)
I'm gonna thriller tonight
I'm gonna thriller tonight
I'm gonna thriller tonight
'Cause this is thriller
